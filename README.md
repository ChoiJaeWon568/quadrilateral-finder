# QuadrilateralFinder

A recent [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13950983/quadrilateral-shape-finding-algorithm) asked how to detect a quadrilateral from a scattered collection of line segments.

These line segments may be the result of a Hough transform, for example.

The repository holds my attempt at solving this problem.
